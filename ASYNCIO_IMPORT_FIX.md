# AsyncIO Import Error Fix

## 🐛 Error

```
⚠️ Crawl4AI + WebBaseLoader failed, trying Firecrawl: cannot access local variable 'asyncio' where it is not associated with a value
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `core/website_crawler/crawler.py` at line 630, there was a local `import asyncio` statement inside the `load_sitemap_documents_parallel()` function's fallback code:

```python
# Line 628-632 (BEFORE - BROKEN):
# Fallback to legacy parallel method
logger.info("📋 Using legacy parallel XML sitemap parsing...")
import asyncio  # ❌ Local import shadows the module-level import
import aiohttp
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
```

This local import was **shadowing** the module-level `import asyncio` (line 16), causing Python to think `asyncio` was a local variable that hadn't been assigned yet when it was referenced earlier in the function (line 544: `semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)`).

## ✅ Fix

Removed the duplicate local import since `asyncio` and `aiohttp` are already imported at the module level:

```python
# Line 628-631 (AFTER - FIXED):
# Fallback to legacy parallel method
logger.info("📋 Using legacy parallel XML sitemap parsing...")
# Note: asyncio and aiohttp already imported at module level
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
```

## 📝 File Changed

**File**: `core/website_crawler/crawler.py` (Line 630)

**Change**: Removed `import asyncio` and `import aiohttp` from fallback code block

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Python's scoping rules:
1. When you `import asyncio` inside a function, Python treats it as a **local variable**
2. This shadows any module-level imports with the same name
3. If the local import happens AFTER you try to use `asyncio`, you get "cannot access local variable"
4. The error occurs because Python sees the later `import asyncio` and assumes all references to `asyncio` in that scope should be local

## 🧪 Testing

The error should no longer occur. You should see:

```log
🕷️ Using Crawl4AI for URL discovery...
✅ Crawl4AI discovered 59 unique URLs

📥 Downloading content for 59 URLs using WebBaseLoader...
✅ Content loading complete:
   - 55 URLs with content extracted
   - 4 URLs failed (stored as URL only)
```

No more "cannot access local variable 'asyncio'" errors! ✅

## 💡 Lesson Learned

**Always check for duplicate imports**, especially local imports that shadow module-level imports. This is a common Python pitfall when refactoring code.

**Best Practice**: Import all necessary modules at the top of the file, not inside functions (unless you have a specific reason like lazy loading or avoiding circular imports).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'`
**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/conversions-digital
cd api
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### 2. API Key Errors
**Problem**: `At least one API key must be provided`
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file:
```bash
# Verify .env exists and has correct format
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
```

#### 3. Memory Issues
**Problem**: Out of memory during large website analysis
**Solution**: Reduce batch sizes:
```json
{
  "indexing_batch_size": 100,
  "k": 10
}
```

#### 4. "No sitemap found" error
**Problem**: Your website might not have a sitemap
**Solutions**:
- Try using product analysis mode instead
- Contact your web developer to add a sitemap
- Provide custom sitemap URL:
```json
{
  "sitemap_url": "https://example.com/sitemap.xml"
}
```

#### 5. Low visibility scores
**Problem**: This is normal for new brands or products
**Solutions**:
- Focus on creating more comprehensive product information
- Consider SEO and content marketing improvements
- Add detailed product specifications to website

#### 6. Analysis takes too long
**Solutions**:
- Start with fewer questions (k=3 or k=5)
- Use product analysis for faster results
- Check your internet connection
- Enable Pinecone for persistent storage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## üöÄ Common Use Cases & Tips

### Use Cases

#### Brand Health Check
Run a website analysis with 10-15 questions to get a comprehensive view of your brand's AI visibility across your product range.

#### New Product Testing  
Use product analysis to test how well AI assistants know about your latest product launches.

#### Competitive Benchmarking
Run analysis for competitors' websites to understand the competitive landscape in AI recommendations.

#### Content Impact Measurement
Run analysis before and after major website updates to measure the impact on AI visibility.

### Tips for Better Results

#### Optimize Your Success
1. **Use clear product categories**: "running shoes" works better than "footwear products"
2. **Keep brand names simple**: Use the name customers actually search for
3. **Test regularly**: AI assistant knowledge updates frequently
4. **Start small**: Begin with 5 questions, then increase for more comprehensive analysis

### Best Practices
- Keep API keys secure and don't share them
- Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected costs  
- Run analyses during business hours for better API performance
- Save your results for comparison over time

- Improved website content with specific product features
- Increased average visibility from 15% to 65% over 3 months

**Key Actions Taken:**
1. Added detailed product specifications to website
2. Created FAQ sections for top products
3. Optimized product category descriptions
4. Regular monitoring and content updates

pip install gunicorn

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Security Considerations
1. **Environment Variables**: Use secure secret management
2. **API Keys**: Rotate keys regularly
3. **HTTPS**: Always use SSL in production
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request rate limiting
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage and costs

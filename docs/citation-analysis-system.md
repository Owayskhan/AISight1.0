# Brand Citation Analysis System

## Overview

The Brand Citation Analysis System is a tool that measures how often different AI assistants mention your brand when answering customer questions. This helps you understand your brand's "visibility" in AI-powered search results, which is becoming increasingly important as more people use AI assistants for product research and purchasing decisions.

## What It Does

The system simulates real customer behavior by:

1. **Generating realistic customer questions** about your products or industry
2. **Asking multiple AI assistants** (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Perplexity) these questions
3. **Analyzing the responses** to see which AI assistants mention your brand
4. **Calculating visibility scores** to show how prominently your brand appears in AI recommendations

## Key Features

### Brand Visibility Measurement
- **Visibility Percentage**: Shows what percentage of AI assistants mention your brand for each question (0-100%)
- **Overall Performance**: Provides average visibility across all questions tested
- **AI Assistant Breakdown**: Shows which specific AI assistants mention your brand most often

### Two Analysis Modes

#### Website Analysis Mode
- Analyzes your entire website to understand your brand and products
- Automatically discovers and indexes your website content
- Generates questions relevant to your product categories
- Best for: Comprehensive brand visibility analysis across your full product range

#### Product Analysis Mode  
- Focuses on a specific product page
- Breaks down the product page into logical sections for better analysis
- Generates questions specific to that individual product
- Best for: Testing visibility of specific products or new launches

### Intelligent Question Generation
- Creates realistic questions that real customers would ask
- Covers different stages of the customer journey:
  - **Awareness**: "What are the best options for [product type]?"
  - **Consideration**: "How does [product A] compare to [product B]?"
  - **Purchase**: "Where can I buy [product type] online?"
  - **Usage**: "How do I set up [product type]?"

### Automated Content Processing
- Automatically extracts key information from your website or product pages
- Converts content into searchable format for AI assistants
- No manual data entry required

## How It Works

### Step 1: Content Analysis
The system examines your website or product page to understand:
- What products you offer
- Who your target customers are
- Key features and benefits
- Your brand positioning

### Step 2: Question Generation
Based on your content, the system creates realistic customer questions that might lead to AI recommendations, such as:
- "What are the best running shoes for beginners?"
- "Which laptop brands offer the best value for money?"
- "Where can I find eco-friendly skincare products?"

### Step 3: AI Assistant Testing
The system asks each generated question to three major AI assistants:
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Google Gemini** (Google)
- **Perplexity** (Perplexity AI)

### Step 4: Citation Analysis
For each AI response, the system:
- Identifies whether your brand was mentioned
- Counts how many times it was mentioned
- Records the specific sentences where your brand appeared

### Step 5: Visibility Scoring
Results are calculated as percentages:
- **0%**: No AI assistants mentioned your brand
- **33.3%**: One out of three AI assistants mentioned your brand
- **66.7%**: Two out of three AI assistants mentioned your brand
- **100%**: All three AI assistants mentioned your brand

## Understanding Your Results

### Visibility Percentage
This is the most important metric. It shows what percentage of AI assistants mentioned your brand when answering a specific question. Higher percentages indicate better AI visibility.

### Citation Breakdown
For each question, you'll see:
- **Which AI assistants mentioned your brand** (✅ Cited)
- **Which AI assistants didn't mention your brand** (❌ Not cited)
- **The exact sentences** where your brand was mentioned
- **Total mention count** across all responses

### Overall Performance Metrics
- **Average Citation Percentage**: Your brand's overall visibility across all questions
- **Questions with Citations**: How many questions resulted in at least one brand mention
- **AI Assistant Performance**: Which AI assistants mention your brand most consistently
